This is an free/opensource school project, developed in one day at 07/10/2018 by Bruno E. Grossi. It's used to create an experimental film based on my own photos and home videos as a "selfie movie".

Use and improve it as your own risk.
You can accidentally create the next cinematographic masterpiece! ;)
